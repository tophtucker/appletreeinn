	<p>
		From late June until early September, the world-famous Tanglewood music festival across the
		street has concerts almost every day. Since traffic gets crazy on our little one-way roads ahead
		of big shows, one of the best things about the Apple Tree is that you can walk there in just
		about ten minutes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that we are up a fairly big hill, so if you stroll at a more dignified pace, that may feel
		longer! We do have a golf cart to take you up and down the hill, though we can’t drop you right
		at the Tanglewood gate because of their strict rules.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Tanglewood grounds typically open at 9 a.m. (check <a href="https://tanglewoodtoday.org"
			>today’s schedule</a
		>
		for specifics), so our favorite approach is to pack a picnic (get stuff at
		<a href="https://guidosfreshmarketplace.com/">Guido’s</a>!) and stroll over there early before
		it gets crazy. The grounds are beautiful and well worth a visit even in their own right.
		(They’re generally open 9–3 p.m. on days without concerts.)
	</p>
	<p>
		To take full advantage of staying so close, we generally don’t recommend driving somewhere else
		to get dinner before a show. But if you are driving, we recommend parking in the West or Upper
		West lots. After the show, Tanglewood traffic cops often make West St. one-way going into town,
		so we like to avoid you taking that detour through town before getting back to your room.
