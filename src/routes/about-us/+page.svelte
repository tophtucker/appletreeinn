			<h1>About us</h1>
			<p>Claire took over the hotel in April 2024, realizing a lifelong dream.</p>
			<p>
				For three summers in college, Claire worked at the concierge desk of the Chatham Bars Inn in
				Cape Cod and fell in love with the industry. She loved the hours sitting at her desk in its
				glamorous old lobby, helping guests experience the best of the area. She later interned at
				Rosewood and then, after business school, managed hotels from the corporate side for
				Starwood. After three years there, she decided she understood enough to strike out on her
				own, and is excited to now be in a position to run it end-to-end: build the business, craft
				the guest experience, and introduce you to town.
			</p>
			<p>
				She lives on the property with her husband, Toph, who works remotely for a <a
					href="https://observablehq.com">different job</a
				> but does some social media for the hotel and is making this website right now.
			</p>

				Christian is Claire’s right-hand man. He followed us out here from the Boston area to escape
				the office desk job life and try something different, and judging from some of the stuff
				we’ve got him doing (climbing ladders to update security cameras or cleaning up bird poop),
				we bet we have achieved “different”. His mom is in Toph’s mom’s book group and has always
				worked at bookstores, which is how she met Christian’s dad. Christian is currently reading:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>The Year of the Locust</em>, by Terry Hayes</li>
				<li><em>Martyr!</em>, by Kaveh Akbar</li>
				<li><em>Four Seasons: The Story of a Business Philosophy</em>, by Isadore Sharp</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				You’re also likely to meet Christian’s German shepherd Max, who is not yet trained to use
				the point-of-sale systems but is otherwise a startlingly good listener. Max will be very
				grateful if you kick a ball down the hill for him to fetch, and then he will gently toss the
				ball at your feet and wait, and so on <em>ad infinitum</em>.

		<p>
			Abby (front desk) grew up like a mile from here; she went to Lenox High and UMass Amherst,
			where she played soccer. We think maybe she likes Disney movies but we’re not sure. Her
			brother goes by “Toph” but weirdly she didn’t even tell our Toph for like two months.

		</div>
		<p>
			Hagai and Adi (chefs) moved here from Israel a couple years ago. Hagai’s been doing dinner in
			the Ostrich Room since the start of the summer, and now Adi is coming aboard for our new
			brunch restaurant, Baladi. Hagai once bought a didgeridoo in Australia and lugged it all over
			the world and has learned to play a little bit.
		</p>
		<img src="./img/sean.jpg" alt="Sean" />
		<p>
			Sean (bar manager) just started so Toph doesn’t know much about him as of writing this but idk
			he seems great.
		</p>
		<img src="./img/giovanna.png" alt="Giovanna" />
		<p>
			Giovanna (bartender) studied linguistics and teaches literacy to kids in North Adams; ask her
			about phonemes and stuff. Or Aquinas. Or her dogs. Or how much she loves the cows at High
			Lawn. Or the Death & Co. cocktail book.
		</p>
		<img src="./img/nic.png" alt="Nic" />
		<p>
			Nic (bartender), also born and raised somewhere around here, is an interior designer by day.
			Ask him about boating around the lake, his parents’ professional ski careers, or navigating
			the Tanglewood ticket counter.
		</p>
		<img src="./img/peter.png" alt="“Peter”" />
		<p>
			Peter (bartender) started recently and I don’t have a photo of him yet but he looks a lot like
			Luke Wilson (left).

			find new-old stuff for it.) Not a single customer came!
