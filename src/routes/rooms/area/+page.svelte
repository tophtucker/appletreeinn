				AVALOCH is a historic estate built high atop a Lenox hill in 1885 by Cecile Bristed, a
				great-granddaughter of John Jacob Astor. She called it <em>The Orchard</em>; in 1952 Roy
				Rappaport turned it into a hotel called <em>Avaloch</em>. Alice Broch of “Alice’s
				Restaurant” ran her third and final restaurant here, <em>Alice’s at Avaloch</em>. In 1983 it
				became the <em>Apple Tree Inn</em>, and today, under Claire, it’s Avaloch again.

				The summer is the peak season. From late June until early September, the world-famous
				Tanglewood music festival across the street has concerts almost every day. Not just the
				Boston Symphony Orchestra in residence, or the popular artists series featuring the likes of
				James Taylor and John Legend; our personal favorite is to pop into the free open rehearsals.
				Or you lifelong learners can try a lecture! For a swim, jump into our pool, with the best
				view on the property, or drive three minutes to the Stockbridge Bowl.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the fall, visitors tend to relax and “peep” the spectacular foliage. We can recommend a
				good local hike for any occasion — bird-watching at Parsons Marsh, a quick loop at Olivia’s
				Overlook, the waterfall at Stevens Glen, a workout at Monument Mountain. Pat the cows and
				get ice cream at High Lawn; go for a horse ride at HomeFarm or HorseWorks. It’s a great time
				to take in the area’s many historic houses and museums, from Edith Wharton to Norman
				Rockwell.

				In the winter, Bousquet ski mountain is a fifteen minute drive away. If you’re a little
				lazier, you can just sled on our hill. If you’re even lazier, like us, you can enjoy a
				“book” (or more often cocktail) by the lobby fire, the outdoor fire pit, the tavern’s
				fireplace <em>inglenook</em>, or one of our four guest rooms with real wood-burning private
				fireplaces. You know Melville wrote Moby Dick right up the road, right? What’s your excuse?
