	<h1>History</h1>

	<p>
		The main house was built in 1885 as a private home for a woman named Cecile Bristed Griffith, an
		adopted descendant of John Jacob Astor. In 1892, Bristed sold the home to a man named Clarence
		Andrews (whose wife eventually divorced him and married the son of Chester A. Arthur, 21st
		president). In 1899, Andrews sold the house to a prominent New York lawyer, Henry Pease, and his
		wife Katharine di Pollone, who used it as their summer home for more than forty years. Pease
		died in the home in August 1937 and di Pollone sold it in 1946 to the Rollins Theatre School,
		which had already opened in the house next door.
	</p>

	<p>
		The theater school was short-lived, and in 1950 the property first became a hotel and seemed to
		have something of a golden era under Adam “Roy” Rappaport who later went on to chair the
		anthropology department at University of Michigan (and brought Margaret Mead to the hotel as
		part of a speakers series in 1952).
	</p>

	<p>
		Rappaport sold in 1959 to Michael Bakwin who constructed the round dining room and the Annex.
		After Bakwin there were a number of owners, including, in the 1970s, Alice Brock of Alice’s
		Restaurant fame. The hotel was home to Alice’s third and final restaurant; the song was written
		about her original location in Stockbridge.
	</p>

	<p>
		In 1983 the property was bought by a couple from New York — the Smiths — and in 1996, after 13
		years of ownership, they were looking to sell. They hired a broker-friend from New York, Joel
		Catalano, whose wife, Sharon Walker, loved the property so much that she and Joel ended up
		buying it themselves.
	</p>

	<p>
		After 25 years Joel &amp; Sharon sold it in January 2021 to Max and James Khaghan, two brothers
		from New York. They reimagined the tavern as the Ostrich Room, upgraded everything to Frette
		linens, installed new Wi-Fi and Sonos, and — crucially — connected the buildings to the town
		sewer!
	</p>

	<p>In April 2024, Claire bought the hotel from them, realizing a lifelong dream.</p>

	<p>
		For three summers in college, Claire had worked at the concierge desk of the Chatham Bars Inn in
		Cape Cod and fell in love with the industry. She loved the hours sitting at her desk in its
		glamorous old lobby, and helping guests experience the best of the area. She later interned at
		Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts and then, after business school, managed hotels for Starwood
		Capital Group.
	</p>

	<p>
		After three years there, she decided she understood enough to strike out on her own. She’s in
		her first season living here and running the inn and can’t wait to meet you!
